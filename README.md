# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm CldMet - Welcome to my GitHub

I'm a software and data engineer focused on backend systems, cloud-native applications, and AI integration. I transitioned into software from a technical engineering background and now work on bespoke application development within a modern tech stack.

This GitHub is my public dev notebook â€” part portfolio, part playground. Some projects are polished, some are experimental, but all reflect real learning and practical problem solving.

## ðŸ§° Current Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks**: React, .NET
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, GitHub Actions, Docker, Linux
- **Other Tools**: Airflow, Spark, MQ, DataStage

## ðŸš§ Learning & Exploration

I use this space to:

- Prototype integrations between modern tools and legacy systems
- Learn container orchestration and CI/CD pipelines
- Experiment with different languages, patterns, and frameworks
- Streamline my dev workflows (CLI-first dev, Linux, custom workflows)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This profile reflects continuous learning. I treat it like an open lab notebook: honest, hands-on, and evolving. Some projects are messy â€” thatâ€™s part of the process.

If you're curious about a project or want to swap notes, feel free to connect.
